# üìÇ Large File Handling System

## Updated File Size Handling

Your CAD Analyzer Pro now handles large files intelligently with progressive processing:

### File Size Tiers

**Small Files (Under 3MB)**
- ‚úÖ Full processing with all features
- ‚úÖ No memory warnings
- ‚úÖ Optimal performance

**Medium Files (3MB - 5MB)**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning message displayed
- ‚úÖ Normal processing with monitoring
- ‚úÖ All features available

**Large Files (5MB - 10MB)**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large file warning
- ‚úÖ Optimized processing with memory management
- ‚úÖ Entity limits applied (1000 max)
- ‚úÖ Progressive loading

**Very Large Files (Over 10MB)**
- ‚ùå Rejected with clear error message
- ‚ùå Too large for safe processing
- ‚ùå Recommendation to reduce file size

## How Large Files Are Processed

### For Files 3MB - 10MB:
1. **Memory Optimization**: Automatic garbage collection
2. **Entity Limiting**: Process up to 1000 entities maximum
3. **Progressive Loading**: Process in chunks to prevent crashes
4. **Essential Elements**: Focus on walls, lines, and key geometry
5. **Crash Protection**: Extensive error handling

### Processing Steps:
1. File size check and warning display
2. Memory optimization activation
3. Chunked entity extraction
4. Essential geometry prioritization
5. Memory cleanup after processing

## User Experience
