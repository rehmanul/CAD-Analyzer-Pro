Expected Functionality

Loading the Plan The plan includes:

Walls (black lines)

Restricted areas (light blue, e.g. stairs, elevators)

Entrances/Exits (in red) â€” no Ã®lot should be placed touching these areas

ÃŽlot Placement Rules The user can define a layout profile, for example:

shell
CopierModifier
10% of Ã®lots between 0 and 1 mÂ²
25% of Ã®lots between 1 and 3 mÂ²
30% of Ã®lots between 3 and 5 mÂ²
35% of Ã®lots between 5 and 10 mÂ²
The application must:

Generate the number of Ã®lots based on these proportions

Place them automatically inside available zones

Avoid red and blue areas

Allow Ã®lots to touch black walls, except near entrances/exits

Corridors Between ÃŽlots If two rows of Ã®lots face each other, a mandatory corridor must be placed between them.

The corridor must touch both Ã®lot rows but must not overlap any Ã®lot.

The corridor width should be configurable.

ðŸŽ¯ Expected Output
The result should look like the second image I sent:

ÃŽlots are neatly arranged

All constraints (red/blue zones) are respected

Corridors are added automatically

No overlaps between Ã®lots

ðŸ›  Required Features in the App
Load a DXF file (or layered image)

Detect zones: walls / restricted / entrances

Allow user to input Ã®lot proportions

Automatically place Ã®lots with:

Space optimization

Constraint compliance

2D/3D visualization (with color codes as in the images)

Export result (PDF or image)
