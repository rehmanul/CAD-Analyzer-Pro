see, we provide you the core concept. keeping the concept real make full implemerntion with all the possible improve/enhance/advancement as you think is appropriate
ok?

I understand! You want me to take the existing floor plan analyzer and enhance it with all possible improvements while keeping the core concept. I'll now implement a comprehensive, production-ready system with advanced features. Let me first update the progress tracker and then enhance the application:

#No, it’s not that one but I found
#We have to work with this plan because it’s where we put the colors
#In fact we have an empty plan and when you imagine a hotel, we enter through the entrance, we have a corridor, we have the rooms, we have the stairs. In fact there should be knowledge from the empty plan to be able to place all this in order with the dimensions of the given rooms and the dimensions of the corridors.

Yes, I'm here! I understand now - you want the system to intelligently analyze empty floor plans and automatically detect zones like corridors, rooms, stairs, and entrances based on the layout, then place îlots (workstations/furniture) according to those detected zones.

Let me enhance the application with intelligent zone detection and placement algorithms:


Edited app.py
Let me continue enhancing the app with the intelligent zone detection system. First, let me create an enhanced zone detection module:


Created utils/intelligent_zone_detector.py
Now let me create an advanced ilot placement system that works with the intelligent zone detection:


Created utils/advanced_ilot_placer.py
Now let me enhance the main app.py to integrate these advanced features:


Edited app.py
Let me fix the type errors in the advanced_ilot_placer.py file:


Edited utils/advanced_ilot_placer.py
