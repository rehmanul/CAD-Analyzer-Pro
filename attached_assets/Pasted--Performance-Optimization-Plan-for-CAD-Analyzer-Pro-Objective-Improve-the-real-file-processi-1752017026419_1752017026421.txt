# Performance Optimization Plan for CAD Analyzer Pro

## Objective
Improve the real file processing speed and analysis performance at the highest level without changing the output or visuals.

---

## Summary of Current Implementation
- **File Processing:**  
  - DXF files parsed manually and with ezdxf fallback.  
  - Image files processed with OpenCV for color-based zone detection.  
- **Îlot Placement:**  
  - Uses shapely for geometry, numpy for calculations, and random sampling for placement.  
  - Placement scoring and optimization with spatial checks.  
- **Corridor Generation:**  
  - Uses shapely and networkx for corridor network generation and validation.  
- **Visualization:**  
  - Plotly-based visualizations with detailed color coding and layout.

## Identified Performance Bottlenecks
- Repeated geometry calculations (buffers, intersections) without caching.  
- Inefficient random sampling and placement attempts.  
- Lack of spatial indexing for fast spatial queries.  
- Nested loops for overlap and distance checks.  
- Line-by-line DXF parsing with string operations.

---

## Proposed Optimizations

### 1. Spatial Indexing
- Use R-tree spatial index (e.g., `rtree` or `shapely.strtree.STRtree`) for:
  - Fast overlap and proximity queries during îlot placement.  
  - Efficient corridor validation and row detection.

### 2. Geometry Caching
- Cache results of expensive geometry operations like polygon buffers and intersections.  
- Reuse cached geometries in placement and corridor generation.

### 3. Placement Algorithm Improvements
- Replace random sampling with grid-based or heuristic placement to reduce attempts.  
- Use vectorized numpy operations where possible.  
- Parallelize independent placement attempts using multiprocessing or concurrent futures.

### 4. DXF Parsing Optimization
- Use compiled regex or binary parsing for DXF instead of line-by-line string parsing.  
- Minimize temporary file writes by parsing directly from bytes.

### 5. Corridor Generation Optimization
- Optimize row detection with clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN) with spatial indexing.  
- Use networkx efficiently by pruning unnecessary edges early.

### 6. Visualization Optimization
- Reduce plotly trace count by grouping similar elements.  
- Use WebGL rendering for large datasets if supported.

## Implementation Steps

1. Integrate spatial indexing in `production_ilot_system.py` and `corridor_generator.py`.  
2. Add caching decorators or manual caches for geometry buffers and intersections.  
3. Refactor placement to use grid or heuristic placement instead of pure random sampling.  
4. Optimize DXF parsing in `advanced_dxf_parser.py` with compiled regex or binary parsing.  
5. Profile and optimize corridor generation loops and network construction.  
6. Optimize visualization by grouping traces and enabling WebGL.

## Expected Outcome
- Significant reduction in file processing and analysis time.  
- Maintain exact output and visuals as per client requirements.  
- Improved scalability for large floor plans and complex layouts.

---

## Notes
- All changes will be backward compatible with existing interfaces.  
- No mock, placeholder, or simplification will be introduced.  
- Real output generation and client visual requirements will be strictly maintained.
